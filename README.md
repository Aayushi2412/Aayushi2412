Hello folks ! Hola Amigos ðŸ˜Š. I am Aayushi, currently pursuing my BTech in Compuetr Science and Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology.
My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. 
I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.
I would rather love to have a â˜• of Java than anything else.
Currently I am trying my hands in Competitive Programming and some cool project building.
